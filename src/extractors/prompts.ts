<instructions>
- Determine the date and time when this scene takes place.
- Look for explicit mentions: "Monday morning", "3pm", "June 15th", "winter evening", etc.
- Look for contextual clues: weather, lighting, activities, meals, seasons.
- If the year is not specified, infer from context or use a reasonable modern year.
- If the month is not specified, infer from seasonal/weather clues or use a reasonable default.
- If the day is not specified, use a reasonable default (e.g., 15 for mid-month).
- Always provide complete values for all fields - never omit anything.
- Use 24-hour format for the hour field.

*The first snow of the season was falling outside the coffee shop window, fat flakes drifting lazily under the streetlights. Elena wrapped her hands around her pumpkin spice latte, watching the evening crowd hurry past with their collars turned up against the cold. It was barely past five, but the sun had already set—one of those November days that made her wish she'd moved somewhere warmer.*

*Her phone buzzed: a text from Marcus saying he was running late, stuck in traffic from the corporate holiday party he'd been dreading all week. She smiled and texted back that she'd order him something warm. The barista had just put up the Christmas decorations—a little early, but Elena didn't mind. The twinkling lights reflected off the dark window, making the shop feel cozy despite the chill creeping in around the door frame.*

}
</output>
<explanation>
EXPLICIT clues:
- "first snow of the season" + "November days" → month is 11 (November)
- "barely past five, but the sun had already set" → hour is 17 (5 PM), early sunset confirms late autumn
- "evening crowd" → period is "evening"

INFERRED values:
- year: Not specified, use current/reasonable modern year (2024)
- day: Not specified, default to mid-month (15)
- minute: "barely past five" suggests just after the hour (15)
- season: "late autumn" - November with first snow, not quite winter yet

Context clues that CONFIRM the inference:
- Pumpkin spice latte (seasonal fall drink)
- Corporate holiday party (November-December timing)
- Christmas decorations going up early (pre-December)
- Cold weather, collars turned up

*The summer sun blazed overhead as Marcus hauled the last cooler out of the truck bed. It was barely noon, but the Fourth of July heat was already oppressive—had to be pushing ninety-five in the shade, if there'd been any shade to speak of. The beach parking lot shimmered with heat mirages, and he could feel the asphalt burning through his sandals.*

*Down by the water, Elena and the kids had already claimed their spot, the red-white-and-blue umbrella visible even from here. She waved, and he could see Sophie jumping up and down with excitement, probably begging to go in the water before lunch. He checked his phone—12:17—and started the long trudge across the sand.*

EXPLICIT clues:
- "Fourth of July" → month: 7, day: 4
- "barely noon" and "12:17" on phone → hour: 12, minute: 17
- "summer sun" → season: "summer"

INFERRED values:
- year: Not specified, use reasonable modern year (2024)
- period: "midday" - noon timeframe

Context clues that CONFIRM:
- Extreme heat (95°F) typical of July
- Beach trip with family (common July 4th activity)
- Patriotic umbrella colors (holiday-appropriate)

*The cherry blossoms were in full bloom along the Potomac, their delicate pink petals drifting down like snow onto the jogging path. Elena stretched her calves against a park bench, watching the early morning runners pass by in the golden dawn light. It was the perfect time of year for this—not too hot yet, the air fresh and cool, the city just starting to wake up.*

*Her fitness tracker showed 6:47 AM and a respectable heart rate after her warm-up. In the distance, she could see the Washington Monument catching the first rays of sunlight, and beyond it, the dome of the Capitol building. A few dog walkers ambled past, coffee cups in hand, taking advantage of the quiet before the tourist crowds arrived.*

}
</output>
<explanation>
EXPLICIT clues:
- "cherry blossoms in full bloom" → late March to mid-April (peak bloom in DC)
- "6:47 AM" on fitness tracker → hour: 6, minute: 47
- "early morning runners" + "golden dawn light" → period: "early morning"

INFERRED values:
- year: Modern year (2024) - Washington Monument, fitness tracker suggest contemporary
- month: 4 (April) - cherry blossom peak season
- day: 8 - mid-peak bloom period, reasonable default
- season: "spring" - cherry blossoms, "not too hot yet," fresh cool air

Location clues (Washington DC) help date the cherry blossoms specifically - they bloom late March through mid-April there.

*Elena yawned and stretched, her eyes heavy after the long day. The movie credits were rolling on the TV, but neither of them had really been watching for the last half hour.*

Elena: "I should probably head to bed. Early meeting tomorrow."

Marcus: "Yeah, me too." *He clicked off the TV and stood, offering her a hand.* "I'll lock up."

*They made their way upstairs, taking turns in the bathroom. By the time Elena had finished her skincare routine and climbed into bed, Marcus was already half-asleep, the lamp on his side still on.*

Elena: *turning off the lamp* "Night."

Marcus: *mumbling* "Night..."

*The morning sun streaming through a gap in the curtains woke Elena before her alarm. She blinked at the clock—6:47 AM—and groaned. Still thirteen minutes before she actually needed to be up. Beside her, Marcus was snoring softly, completely dead to the world.*
</input>

</output>
<explanation>
This is an OVERNIGHT time skip:
- currentTime: 10:30 PM Tuesday
- They went to bed shortly after (maybe 15-20 min for bathroom routine)
- Elena wakes at 6:47 AM
- Total elapsed: approximately 8 hours 17 minutes

The scene explicitly moves from "heading to bed" at night to "morning sun" waking her at 6:47 AM. We calculate from 10:30 PM to 6:47 AM = 8h 17m.

Key indicators of overnight skip:
- Going to bed at night
- "Morning sun streaming through curtains"
- Specific wake-up time given (6:47 AM)
- "Before her alarm" implies morning routine starting

*The argument had been building for twenty minutes now, voices rising with each exchange. Elena stood by the window, arms crossed, while Marcus paced the length of the living room.*

Marcus: "I just don't understand why you didn't tell me about the job offer!"

Elena: "Because I knew you'd react exactly like this!"

Marcus: "Like what? Like someone who thought we made decisions together?"

*Elena flinched. That one landed. She turned away from him, staring out at the street below without really seeing it.*

Elena: "I haven't even decided if I'm taking it yet."

Marcus: "But you're considering it. You're considering moving across the country and you didn't think that was worth mentioning?"

*The silence stretched between them, heavy and painful. Finally, Elena spoke, her voice smaller than before.*

Elena: "I was scared. I didn't know how to bring it up."

Marcus: *sighing heavily, running a hand through his hair* "I just... I need a minute." *He grabbed his jacket from the couch.* "I'm going for a walk."

*The door closed behind him with a quiet click that somehow felt louder than all the shouting.*

<explanation>
This is REAL-TIME dialogue with stated duration:
- "The argument had been building for twenty minutes now" establishes base time
- The rest of the exchange takes another ~5 minutes of heated dialogue
- Total: approximately 25 minutes

NO time skip occurs - this is a continuous scene. The time represents:
- 20 minutes of prior argument (mentioned)
- ~5 minutes of the dialogue we see
- Marcus leaving at the end

Key principle: Emotional conversations feel longer but don't actually take much clock time. An intense 5-minute argument can feel like an hour.

*Elena grabbed her laptop bag and headed for the door, already running late for the presentation.*

Elena: "I'll see you tonight!"

Marcus: *from the kitchen* "Good luck! You've got this!"

*The commute was brutal—an accident on the highway had traffic backed up for miles. Elena spent forty-five minutes crawling along, mentally rehearsing her talking points and trying not to check the clock every thirty seconds. By the time she finally pulled into the parking garage, she had exactly three minutes to get upstairs.*

*She power-walked through the lobby, badge already in hand, and caught the elevator just as the doors were closing. The conference room was on the twelfth floor. She watched the numbers climb with growing anxiety—8, 9, 10, 11, 12—and practically sprinted down the hallway when the doors opened.*

*She slid into the conference room at 9:58 AM, two minutes before her slot. Her boss raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Elena set up her laptop with slightly shaking hands and took a deep breath. She'd made it.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "days": 0,

Time skip with EXPLICIT endpoint:
- Starts: 9:00 AM (currentTime, she's "already running late")
- Ends: 9:58 AM (explicitly stated - "slid into the conference room at 9:58 AM")
- Total: 58 minutes

Breakdown of time passage:
- Brief goodbye at home: 1-2 min
- 45 minutes of commute (explicitly stated)
- Parking, walking, elevator: ~10 min
- Total checks out: 2 + 45 + 10 ≈ 57-58 minutes

When EXACT times are given, use them for precision rather than estimating.

Elena: *She pushed through the revolving door into the Meridian Grand Hotel, shaking raindrops from her umbrella. The lobby stretched before her in all its art deco glory—geometric patterns in the marble floor, brass fixtures polished to a mirror shine, and a massive crystal chandelier casting prismatic light across the space. A string quartet played something classical near the fountain, their music competing with the murmur of well-dressed guests and the occasional ding of elevator arrivals.*

*She spotted the concierge desk to her left, staffed by a woman in an immaculate uniform, and beyond it the entrance to what looked like a high-end restaurant. The check-in counter dominated the far wall, where a short queue of travelers waited with their luggage. Elena's heels clicked against the marble as she made her way toward the seating area near the windows, where oversized leather armchairs surrounded low coffee tables scattered with magazines.*

"Impressive," *she murmured, taking in the fifteen-foot ceilings and the gallery of black-and-white photographs lining the walls.*

*The submarine's control room was cramped and humid, every surface covered in switches, dials, and screens displaying sonar readouts. Captain Reyes stood at the periscope station, one eye pressed to the viewfinder while her XO monitored the depth gauge nearby. Red emergency lighting bathed everything in an ominous glow—they'd been running silent for six hours now, and the tension was palpable.*

*Banks of monitors showed the surrounding ocean in ghostly green sonar imagery. The helm station dominated the front of the room, where two junior officers sat rigid at their controls. Overhead, pipes and cables snaked across the ceiling, occasionally dripping condensation onto the metal deck plates below. A navigation chart was spread across the plotting table, weighted down with coffee mugs and a brass compass.*

*The air recycler hummed its constant drone, barely masking the distant ping of active sonar from somewhere above them.*

Reyes: "Maintain current depth. Nobody makes a sound."

*Marcus found himself in what had clearly once been a grand ballroom, though decades of neglect had transformed it into something out of a gothic nightmare. Faded murals peeled from the walls in long strips, revealing water-stained plaster beneath. The parquet floor, once polished to a gleam, was now warped and broken in places, with weeds pushing through the gaps where it met the crumbling baseboards.*

*Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light filtering through broken windows high above. A massive fireplace dominated one wall, its marble mantle cracked and blackened with old soot. Someone had dragged a mattress into the corner—recent, by the look of it, with rumpled blankets and empty food cans scattered nearby. Graffiti covered the lower portions of the walls, tags and crude drawings layered over each other.*

*The remnants of a crystal chandelier lay shattered in the center of the room, its brass frame twisted and tarnished. Marcus could hear pigeons cooing somewhere in the rafters above, and the distant sound of traffic from the street outside.*

*The bass from the club behind them was still audible, a muffled thump-thump-thump that vibrated through the pavement. Elena stepped out into the cool night air, grateful to escape the crush of bodies inside. The street was quiet at this hour—just a few smokers huddled near the entrance and a taxi idling at the curb.*

*Across the street, a kebab shop's neon sign flickered on and off, casting red and blue shadows on the wet pavement. The rain had stopped, but puddles still dotted the sidewalk, reflecting the glow of the streetlamps. A bouncer in a black jacket stood by the velvet rope, checking his phone while a couple argued nearby about whose turn it was to call an Uber.*

- The 'area' should be neighborhood + city + country/region (e.g. 'Downtown, Huntsville, AL', 'Farringdon, London, UK'). Always include country/region.
- The 'place' should be a SPECIFIC named location:
  - For buildings: Use FULL proper names (e.g. 'Meridian Grand Hotel' not 'Hotel')

- Props rules (IMPORTANT):
  - Props are PHYSICAL OBJECTS that characters could pick up or interact with
  - Each prop should be ONE SINGLE ITEM (e.g. "Neon sign" not "Neon signs reflecting in puddles")
  - NO sounds, smells, or atmosphere (e.g. NOT "Bass thumping" or "Smell of smoke")
  - NO people or their activities (e.g. NOT "Smokers huddled by door")
  - NO clothing that characters are currently WEARING - that goes in character outfits
  - Only include clothing as props if REMOVED and placed somewhere (e.g. "Discarded jacket on chair")
- Update props: new items introduced, items picked up/removed, items changing state.
- If no location change occurred, return the previous location but consider prop changes.
- Be careful to track items that have been picked up (remove from props) or put down (add to props).

*Elena finally let herself relax, kicking off her heels with a relieved sigh. They tumbled across the hardwood floor, coming to rest near the closet door. She shrugged out of her blazer and tossed it carelessly onto the armchair by the window, then padded over to the bed and flopped down face-first into the pillows.*

*After a moment, she rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling, her stockinged feet hanging off the edge of the mattress. The room was quiet except for the soft hum of the air conditioning and the muffled sounds of city traffic from far below. She reached over to the nightstand and grabbed her phone, scrolling through messages she'd been ignoring all day.*

*The afternoon light filtered through the sheer curtains, casting long shadows across the Persian rug. Her laptop sat open on the desk across the room, screen dark but charging light blinking steadily. She should probably check her work email, but the thought made her groan and bury her face in the nearest pillow instead.*

- Removed clothing added to props: "Black heels near closet door" and "Armchair by window with discarded blazer" - both include WHERE the items ended up
- New room props identified: Items she interacts with (bed, nightstand, phone) plus environmental details (rug, curtains, laptop) that could become relevant
- State noted where relevant: "laptop (charging)" because the blinking light was mentioned and could matter

*The storm had gotten worse since they'd arrived. Marcus stood at the cabin window, watching lightning illuminate the forest in staccato bursts. Rain hammered against the glass so hard he could feel the vibration through the frame. Behind him, Elena had gotten the old wood stove going—it crackled and popped, slowly pushing back against the chill that had seeped into the abandoned structure.*

*She'd found some moth-eaten blankets in the closet and spread them on the dusty floor near the stove, creating a makeshift camp. Their wet jackets hung from nails in the wall, dripping steadily onto the warped floorboards. Marcus had dragged in some firewood from the covered porch, stacking it near the door where it could dry out.*

*The cabin was sparse—just the one room with a rusted kitchenette in the corner and what might have once been a bed frame, now just bare springs and rotten wood. But it had a roof that mostly didn't leak, and right now that was enough.*

Elena: "Come sit by the fire. You're not going to make the storm stop by glaring at it."

- area: Stays the same - they're still in the same mountain region
- place: Changed from "Forest Trail" to "Abandoned Ranger Cabin" - they found shelter and moved indoors
- position: "Main room" - simple spatial designation. NOT "standing at window" or "by the fire"
- props transformation: Trail props completely replaced with cabin interior. Note we track:
  * Items they brought/affected: "Wet jackets hanging on wall nails", "Firewood stack by door"
  * Environmental features: "Wood stove (lit, crackling)", "Rain-streaked window"
  * Potential interaction points: "Rusted kitchenette", "Broken bed frame", "Moth-eaten blankets"

*Sarah carefully set down her coffee cup, leaving a ring on the manuscript pages scattered across the table. The interview had been going for nearly an hour now, and the small conference room felt increasingly claustrophobic. Detective Morrison sat across from her, his recorder blinking red between them, while his partner leaned against the wall by the door—blocking the exit, Sarah noted.*

*The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, one of them flickering intermittently in a way that was slowly driving her crazy. Someone had tried to make the room less institutional with a potted plant in the corner, but it was clearly fake and covered in dust. The blinds were drawn, cutting off any view of the bullpen outside, though she could hear phones ringing and people talking through the thin walls.*

*Morrison slid another photograph across the table—the third one in the last ten minutes. Sarah forced herself not to react, keeping her hands flat on the cool surface of the table. The chair was deliberately uncomfortable, she realized. Everything about this room was designed to make people want to leave, to say whatever would get them out fastest.*

<location>Minneapolis, Minnesota - Elena's Apartment (Living room)</location>
<input>
*Elena pressed her forehead against the cold window, watching the snow pile up on the fire escape outside. The forecast had warned about this—the worst blizzard in a decade, they said. Already the cars parked on the street below were nothing but white lumps, and the wind was howling loud enough to hear through the double-paned glass.*

*She pulled her cardigan tighter and retreated to the couch, where Marcus had made a nest of blankets. The radiator was clanking away in the corner, working overtime, but it could only do so much against a Minnesota winter.*

Marcus: "Power company says to expect outages tonight." *He held up his phone.* "I filled the bathtub just in case."

Elena: "Smart." *She curled up against him, stealing his warmth.* "I'm glad I'm not trying to drive in this."

*Another gust of wind rattled the windows, and somewhere in the building, a door slammed.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "weather": "Heavy snowfall with blizzard conditions, strong winds",
  "temperature": 68
}
</output>
<explanation>
WEATHER: Explicitly described - "worst blizzard in a decade," heavy snow visible on cars/fire escape, howling wind, windows rattling.

TEMPERATURE: 68°F - This is INDOOR temperature:
- They're inside the apartment (living room)
- Radiator is "working overtime" but "can only do so much"
- Elena is cold enough to pull cardigan tighter and seek Marcus's warmth
- 68°F represents a slightly cool but still heated indoor space during a blizzard
- Outside would be well below freezing (single digits or negative), but we report indoor temp since they're indoors

Key principle: When characters are indoors, report indoor temperature but outdoor weather. The weather affects the scene (visible through windows, wind rattling them) but temperature should reflect their immediate environment.

<location>Phoenix, Arizona - Desert Botanical Garden (Main pathway)</location>
<input>
*The heat was absolutely brutal. Marcus could feel sweat soaking through his shirt within minutes of leaving the air-conditioned visitor center. The sun beat down from a cloudless sky, reflecting off the pale gravel paths until he had to squint even with sunglasses.*

*Elena had insisted on seeing the saguaro collection, and he'd agreed before checking the weather. 115 degrees, the sign at the entrance had warned. Even the cacti looked like they were struggling. They passed a family heading back toward the buildings, the kids red-faced and whining, one of them being carried.*

Elena: *fanning herself with the park map* "Maybe we should have done this in the morning."

Marcus: "You think?" *He pointed to a shaded ramada up ahead.* "Let's at least get out of direct sun."

*They hurried to the shade, but it barely helped. The air itself felt like an oven, shimmering over the desert landscape in visible waves.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "weather": "Clear, cloudless, extreme sun exposure",
  "temperature": 115
}
</output>
<explanation>
WEATHER: "Clear, cloudless, extreme sun exposure"
- "cloudless sky" explicitly stated
- Emphasis on brutal direct sunlight
- No moisture, no clouds, no relief

TEMPERATURE: 115°F - OUTDOOR temperature:
- Explicitly stated on the entrance sign
- They're outdoors on the garden pathway
- Multiple heat indicators: soaking sweat, squinting, kids overheating, shimmering air
- This is actual ambient temperature, not just "feels like"

Phoenix in August commonly hits 115°F+. The scene confirms extreme heat through physical reactions (sweating through shirt, seeking shade desperately) and environmental details (shimmering air, heat waves).

<location>Portland, Oregon - Waterfront Park (Riverside path)</location>
<input>
*The rain had been falling steadily all afternoon, the kind of gray Pacific Northwest drizzle that wasn't heavy enough for an umbrella but somehow still got you soaked. Elena pulled up the hood of her rain jacket and fell into step beside Marcus, their boots splashing through shallow puddles on the riverside path.*

*The Willamette River was high and fast-moving, swollen with runoff. Across the water, the lights of downtown Portland glowed soft and hazy through the mist. A few other hardy souls were out walking—joggers, mostly, seemingly immune to the weather.*

Marcus: "I love this, you know." *He spread his arms, letting the rain hit his face.* "Everyone else hides from it, but this is real Portland."

Elena: "You're insane." *But she was smiling.* "My socks are going to be wet for days."

*A gust of wind blew spray off the river, adding to the general dampness. The temperature had dropped since sunset, and Elena could see her breath now, thin wisps of vapor disappearing into the gray.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "weather": "Steady light rain, misty, overcast",
  "temperature": 48
}
</output>
<explanation>
WEATHER: "Steady light rain, misty, overcast"
- "Gray Pacific Northwest drizzle" - classic description of light but persistent rain
- "Mist" explicitly mentioned (downtown visible but hazy)
- Rain steady enough to soak through clothes over time
- Overcast implied by gray sky, no sun mentioned

TEMPERATURE: 48°F - OUTDOOR temperature:
- They're outside on the riverside path
- Cool enough to see breath ("thin wisps of vapor")
- Temperature "dropped since sunset" - evening in October
- 48°F is typical for Portland in October evening with rain
- Not cold enough for winter gear, but uncomfortable when wet

Note the difference from indoor scenes: here we track actual outdoor temperature since they're outside in the weather.

*The air conditioning hit them like a wall of blessed relief as they pushed through the visitor center doors. Marcus stood just inside the entrance for a moment, arms spread, letting the cool air wash over his sweat-soaked shirt.*

Marcus: "I'm never leaving this building."

Elena: *laughing* "Dramatic." *She made a beeline for the water fountain, drinking deeply.* "But also same."

*The cafe was sparsely populated—most sensible people had either come in the early morning or stayed home entirely. They found a table by the window, where they could watch the heat shimmer outside without being in it. A ceiling fan rotated lazily overhead, adding to the refrigerated chill.*

Elena: "I think my skin is still radiating heat."

Marcus: "Well, the sign says it's 72 in here, so you should cool down eventually." *He nodded toward a digital temperature display on the wall.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "weather": "Clear, cloudless, extreme sun exposure",
  "temperature": 72
}
</output>
<explanation>
WEATHER: UNCHANGED - "Clear, cloudless, extreme sun exposure"
- They moved indoors, but weather outside hasn't changed
- Still visible through the window (heat shimmer)
- Weather tracks outdoor conditions even when characters are inside

TEMPERATURE: 115°F → 72°F - CHANGED due to moving indoors
- Explicitly stated on digital display: 72°F
- Strong AC indicated by "blessed relief" and "refrigerated chill"
- Dramatic contrast between outdoor heat and indoor comfort
- Temperature tracks characters' immediate environment

This is the key indoor/outdoor distinction: when characters move inside, temperature changes to reflect their environment, but weather remains the outdoor condition.

*The power had gone out two hours ago. Elena and Marcus huddled together on the couch under every blanket they owned, their breath visible in the flashlight beam. The radiator had gone cold and silent, and the temperature was dropping fast.*

*Outside, the storm had intensified—if that was even possible. The wind was screaming now, a constant howl that made the old building creak and groan. Through the frosted window, Elena couldn't even see the building across the street anymore, just a wall of swirling white.*

Marcus: *checking his phone* "Still no update on when power's coming back."

Elena: *shivering* "How cold do you think it is in here now?"

Marcus: "I'd guess low fifties? The pipes are going to freeze if this keeps up."

*She pulled the blankets tighter, pressing herself against him. At least body heat was free.*

<explanation>
WEATHER: Updated from "Heavy snowfall with blizzard conditions" → "Severe blizzard, whiteout conditions, dangerously high winds"
- Storm has intensified ("if that was even possible")
- Visibility now zero (can't see building across street)
- Wind upgraded from "strong" to "screaming" and "constant howl"
- Weather can change during scenes; track these updates

TEMPERATURE: 68°F → 52°F - DROPPED due to power outage
- Power out for 2 hours, radiator cold
- Breath now visible indoors (wasn't before)
- Marcus estimates "low fifties"
- Temperature dropping because heating failed
- Still indoor temp, but indoor conditions have changed dramatically

Both fields changed this time: weather intensified AND indoor temperature dropped. Track each independently based on what the scene describes.

*The rain had finally stopped, though water still dripped from the gutters and the trees in Marcus's backyard. Elena stood on the enclosed back porch, a mug of tea warming her hands, watching the clouds break apart to reveal patches of stars.*

Marcus: *joining her* "Hey, look at that—you can actually see the moon."

*It was true. The clouds were moving fast, pushed by upper-level winds, and a three-quarter moon was emerging from behind them. The air felt cleaner now, washed fresh by the rain, though it had gotten noticeably colder since the sky cleared.*

Elena: "It's beautiful. But cold." *She pulled her sweater sleeves down over her hands.* "Probably thirty degrees colder than when we were at the waterfront."

Marcus: "Clear skies do that. All the heat radiates away." *He put an arm around her.* "Want to go back inside?"

Elena: "In a minute. I want to see if we can spot any constellations."
</input>
<output>
{
  "weather": "Clear and clearing, post-rain, partial moon visible",
  "temperature": 45
}
</output>
<explanation>
WEATHER: "Steady light rain, misty, overcast" → "Clear and clearing, post-rain, partial moon visible"
- Rain stopped (major change)
- Clouds breaking up, moon and stars visible
- "Post-rain" captures the recent weather context (water dripping, fresh air)

TEMPERATURE: 48°F → 45°F - SLIGHT drop
- They're on an ENCLOSED porch (semi-outdoor)
- Clear skies = radiative cooling (Marcus explains this)
- Elena notes it's "noticeably colder" since clouds cleared
- ~3°F drop is realistic for clearing skies in evening
- Not as cold as fully outdoors would be, but cooler than inside

The enclosed porch is a middle ground - affected by outdoor temperature but somewhat sheltered. Temperature reflects this semi-outdoor environment.

She'd thrown on her favorite oversized cardigan over a simple white tank top before leaving the apartment, paired with the worn jeans she always reached for on days when she needed comfort. Her hair was still damp from the shower, pulled back in a messy ponytail that dripped occasionally onto her shoulders.*

*She wrapped both hands around her latte, letting the warmth seep into her fingers. The shop's AC was cranked too high, as usual, and she wished she'd worn something warmer. Her phone buzzed on the table—probably Marcus again—but she couldn't bring herself to look at it yet. Instead, she watched a businessman outside struggle with his umbrella in the wind, his expensive suit getting splattered despite his efforts.*

*Her laptop pinged with a new email notification. Work. Always work. Elena sighed and finally pulled the computer closer, resigned to dealing with whatever crisis had erupted overnight. Her reading glasses were somewhere in her bag, but she didn't feel like digging for them.*

<explanation>
- position: "Corner booth by window" - spatial location extracted from "usual corner booth" and "stared out the window"
- activity: Combines her current action (checking emails) with physical detail (holding latte) to paint the scene
- mood: Multiple moods captured - "melancholy" from window staring, "reluctant" from avoiding phone/emails, "tired" from overall tone
- physicalState: "cold" (AC too high, wished for warmer clothes) and "damp hair" (still wet from shower)
- outfit inference reasoning:
  * jacket: "Oversized cardigan" explicitly mentioned
  * torso: "White tank top" explicitly mentioned
  * legs: "Worn jeans" explicitly mentioned, added "comfortable" based on context about comfort-seeking
  * underwear: NOT mentioned, but inferred as "Cotton bra and panties" - simple, practical choice matching the casual comfort-focused outfit. A tank top requires a bra; the casual vibe suggests cotton over lace
  * socks: NOT mentioned, but inferred as "Ankle socks" - jeans typically worn with socks; casual outfit suggests simple ankle socks
  * footwear: NOT mentioned, but inferred as "Canvas sneakers" - casual comfort outfit + rainy day + jeans strongly suggests sneakers over heels or sandals
  * neck: null - no neckwear mentioned or contextually implied
  * back: null - she's sitting in a cafe, no bag/backpack mentioned
- Key principle: NEVER use "unspecified" or "unknown" - always make a reasonable inference based on the outfit style, occasion, and character context

*Detective Morrison entered the precinct looking like he hadn't slept in days—which, to be fair, he hadn't. His tie was loosened, top button undone, and his usually crisp white dress shirt had developed a concerning coffee stain near the pocket. The shoulder holster was visible under his rumpled gray suit jacket, service weapon a familiar weight against his ribs.*

*He tossed his badge on the desk and dropped into his chair with a groan, the old springs protesting loudly. Three days on this case and they were no closer to finding the girl. The case files were still spread across his desk from last night, photos and reports mixed together in organized chaos that only made sense to him.*

*His partner Chen looked up from her own desk, raising an eyebrow at his disheveled state. She was, as always, immaculately put together—pressed navy blazer, hair in a perfect bun, not a wrinkle in sight. How she managed it on the same hours he was working remained one of life's great mysteries.*

Morrison: "Don't say it."
Chen: "Wasn't going to say anything." *She slid a fresh coffee across the desk toward him.* "You look like hell, by the way."

TWO characters extracted - both detectives present in the scene.

Morrison:
- physicalState: "sleep-deprived" and "disheveled" - multiple states can coexist
- outfit details: State descriptors in parentheses - "(coffee-stained, top button undone)" for the shirt
- legs: "Gray suit trousers" inferred to match the "gray suit jacket" - suits come as sets
- underwear: "White undershirt, boxers" - male detective in a suit would typically wear an undershirt; boxers are standard professional default for men
- socks: "Black dress socks" - standard with suit and dark shoes
- footwear: "Black leather oxfords" - classic detective/professional male footwear, matches suit

Chen:
- mood includes "slightly amused" from her teasing
- outfit is described as immaculate/pressed - reflects personality
- torso: "White silk blouse" inferred - blazers typically worn over blouses in professional settings; silk matches her put-together appearance
- underwear: "Seamless nude bra and panties" - professional women often wear seamless undergarments under fitted clothing to avoid visible lines
- socks: "Sheer nude knee-highs" - professional women in trousers often wear knee-highs rather than full pantyhose for comfort
- footwear: "Navy low heels" - matches the navy blazer, professional but practical for detective work

Key inference principles:
1. Match underwear formality to outfit formality (silk blouse → nicer undergarments)
2. Consider practicality (detective work → low heels, not stilettos)
3. Color coordinate where logical (navy suit pieces together)
4. Account for gender norms in professional settings

*The Pikachu bounced excitedly around the Pokemon Center lobby, cheeks sparking with barely contained electricity. Its trainer, a young woman with bright pink hair, was trying desperately to calm it down before it short-circuited the healing machines again.*

Nurse Joy: "Perhaps some fresh air would help? The courtyard is lovely this time of day."

*The trainer—her name tag read 'Zoe'—sighed and scooped up the energetic electric mouse, tucking it under her arm like a fuzzy yellow football. She was dressed for travel: sturdy hiking boots, cargo shorts with about a million pockets, and a fitted black athletic top that had seen better days. A large backpack sat on the bench behind her, covered in patches from different gym badges and travel destinations.*

Zoe: "Sorry, he gets like this after battles. Too much energy and nowhere to put it."

*The Pikachu's ears twitched, and it let out a cheerful 'Pika!' before settling down slightly, though its tail still wagged against Zoe's hip.*

THREE characters extracted, including the Pokemon:

Pikachu (non-human):
- ALL outfit slots are null - Pokemon don't wear clothes by default
- physicalState: "excess electrical charge" - this IS tracked for non-humans as it's a relevant physical condition
- mood still tracked normally - Pokemon have emotions

Zoe (Pokemon trainer):
- outfit matches "dressed for travel" description with practical/athletic theme
- underwear: "Sports bra and athletic briefs" - inferred from athletic top and active lifestyle. Someone in hiking gear and athletic wear would wear athletic undergarments, not lace
- socks: "Thick hiking socks" - hiking boots require substantial socks; this is a practical inference
- State descriptor "(worn)" added to athletic top since text mentioned "had seen better days"

Nurse Joy (uniform character):
- Iconic uniform character - nurse cap, pink dress, white accessories
- torso AND legs both list "Pink nurse uniform dress" - it's a single garment covering both
- underwear: "White practical bra and panties" - professional medical setting suggests practical, likely white to not show under uniform
- socks: "White knee-high stockings" - traditional nurse uniform includes white stockings
- footwear: "White nursing shoes" - comfortable, professional medical footwear

Key species principle: Pokemon, animals, and non-humanoid creatures get null for ALL outfit slots unless they're explicitly wearing something (like a Pokemon costume or accessory). But they still have mood and physicalState.

<why_bad>
- "Unspecified undergarments" and "Unknown" are NEVER acceptable - always infer based on outfit style and context
- Outfit items lack detail: "Cardigan" should be "Oversized cardigan", "Tank top" should be "White tank top", "Jeans" should be "Worn comfortable jeans"
- "Shoes" is too vague - specify the type based on outfit context (sneakers, heels, boots, etc.)
- Missing state descriptors where relevant
- Should infer: casual outfit = cotton underwear, ankle socks, canvas sneakers

*Elena stretched her arms over her head with a yawn, then reached down to unzip her boots. The left one came off easily, thudding to the floor beside the couch, but the right one's zipper stuck halfway. She muttered a curse and tugged harder until it finally gave way, sending her sock-clad foot free.*

*She wiggled her toes gratefully and pulled her legs up onto the cushions, tucking them beneath her. The blazer she'd been wearing all day felt suddenly suffocating, so she shrugged out of it and tossed it over the back of the couch. Much better. She loosened the top two buttons of her blouse, feeling like she could finally breathe.*

Marcus: *glancing up from his laptop* "Long day?"

Elena: "You have no idea." *She pulled the elastic from her hair, shaking her ponytail loose and running her fingers through it.* "Peterson had me in meetings from nine to six. I think I've permanently lost feeling in my feet."

*She rubbed her neck, tilting her head from side to side to work out the knots. The headache that had been building all afternoon was finally starting to fade now that she was home.*

Multiple changes tracked for Elena:

POSITION changed: "Standing in the entryway" → "Curled up on the couch" - she moved and changed posture

MOOD evolved: "tired, stressed" → "exhausted, relieved, comfortable" - same base tiredness but context shifted to being home

PHYSICAL STATE updated:
- "tension headache" → "headache fading" - still present but improving, as noted in text
- Added "sore feet" and "neck tension" - explicitly mentioned complaints

OUTFIT changes (4 items affected):
1. head: "Hair in ponytail" → null - she removed the elastic and let her hair down
2. jacket: "Charcoal gray blazer" → null - tossed over back of couch (FULLY removed = null)
3. torso: "White silk blouse" → "White silk blouse (top buttons undone)" - PARTIALLY changed, so we keep the item but add state descriptor
4. footwear: "Black leather ankle boots" → null - both boots removed (note: we don't need to track each boot separately since both were removed)

Items that did NOT change remain exactly as they were: legs, underwear, socks

Marcus: Minimal changes - just added "attentive" to mood since he asked about her day. Everything else unchanged.

Key principles demonstrated:
- Fully removed items → null (blazer, boots, hair elastic)
- Partially modified items → keep item with state descriptor (blouse with buttons undone)
- Hair accessories count as "head" slot
- Physical states can be updated/evolved, not just added/removed

*The rain had soaked through everything. Marcus peeled off his ruined leather jacket—beyond saving at this point—and dropped it in a wet heap by the door. His t-shirt underneath was plastered to his skin, and he grabbed the hem and pulled it over his head without ceremony, revealing the fresh bandage wrapped around his ribs.*

Elena: *eyes widening* "Jesus, what happened to you?"

Marcus: "Just a scratch." *He kicked off his waterlogged boots, grimacing as he put weight on his left ankle.* "The other guy looks worse."

*He limped toward the bathroom, leaving a trail of wet footprints on the hardwood. His jeans hung heavy with water, but he couldn't deal with those until he got somewhere with a towel. His socks squelched with every step—definitely ruined.*

Elena: "Marcus, that bandage is bleeding through. Sit down, let me look at it."

*He paused at the bathroom door, one hand braced against the frame. In the better lighting, Elena could see the bruise forming along his jaw and the split in his lip that was still seeping.*

Marcus: "I'm fine. Just need to dry off."

Significant changes to Marcus after a rough encounter:

POSITION: "Outside, approaching the building" → "At bathroom doorway" - tracked his movement through the scene

ACTIVITY: Updated to current action with posture detail

MOOD: "determined, pained" → "stubborn, pained, dismissive" - evolved based on his dialogue and refusal of help

PHYSICAL STATE (major updates):
- "injured ribs (bandaged)" → "injured ribs (bandaged, bleeding through)" - state worsened/more visible
- Added "sprained left ankle" - grimacing when putting weight on it
- Added "bruised jaw" - Elena sees it in better lighting
- Added "split lip (bleeding)" - seeping mentioned
- Added "soaking wet" - general state from rain

OUTFIT changes with STATE DESCRIPTORS:
- jacket: "Black leather jacket" → null - removed and dropped (described as ruined, but that's the location prop system's concern)
- torso: "Gray cotton t-shirt" → null - pulled off, revealing bandage
- legs: "Dark blue jeans" → "Dark blue jeans (waterlogged)" - NOT removed but state changed significantly
- socks: "Black crew socks" → "Black crew socks (soaked, ruined)" - still wearing them but state matters
- footwear: "Brown leather boots" → null - kicked off

Elena's changes are minor:
- mood: "worried, anxious" → "alarmed, worried, frustrated" - escalated upon seeing his condition
- activity: Updated to reflect her current action
- Everything else unchanged

Key principles:
- Use state descriptors for items affected but not removed: "(waterlogged)", "(soaked, ruined)"
- Physical states can stack - list all relevant conditions
- Update physical state descriptors when conditions change: "(bandaged)" → "(bandaged, bleeding through)"
- Track position changes through the scene

*The dance studio mirrors reflected their movements as Elena helped Sarah through the routine one more time. Sarah had finally gotten the hang of the footwork, her sneakers squeaking against the polished floor as she spun. But the August heat was brutal even with the AC running, and both women were feeling it.*

Elena: "Take five, you've earned it." *She grabbed her water bottle from the bench and took a long drink, then poured some over the back of her neck.* "God, it's like a sauna in here."

*Sarah flopped down onto the floor, sprawling on her back with her arms spread wide. She pulled her tank top away from her skin, fanning herself with the fabric.*

Sarah: "I don't know how you do this for a living. I'm dying."

*Elena laughed and sat down beside her, stretching her legs out. She reached down and pulled off her dance sneakers, peeling away the damp socks underneath and tossing them toward her bag. Her feet were red and sore from two hours of practice.*

Sarah: *sitting up and doing the same* "Yeah, okay, that's a good idea." *She kicked off her own sneakers but left her socks on, too tired to bother.*

*They sat in companionable silence for a moment, catching their breath. Elena pulled her damp sports bra strap away from her shoulder, unsticking it from her skin with a grimace.*

Both characters taking a break with different clothing changes:

ELENA:
- position: Moved from "Center of dance floor" to "Sitting on dance floor near bench"
- physicalState: Expanded from just "sweating" to "sweating heavily", "sore feet", "overheated" - conditions worsened/more detailed
- outfit changes:
  * torso: Added state "(damp)" - the sports bra is wet from sweat (pulling strap away from skin)
  * socks: "White no-show dance socks" → null - explicitly removed and tossed toward bag
  * footwear: "Black dance sneakers" → null - pulled off
  * head stays "Hair in high bun" - not mentioned as changed

SARAH:
- position: Changed to floor from standing/dancing
- physicalState: "sweating, tired" → "sweating heavily, exhausted, overheated" - more intense after practice
- outfit changes:
  * torso: Added state "(pulled away from skin)" - she's fanning herself with it
  * footwear: "White running sneakers" → null - kicked off
  * socks: UNCHANGED at "White ankle socks" - explicitly mentioned she left them on ("too tired to bother")

Key principles demonstrated:
- When text explicitly says someone DIDN'T remove something, keep it
- State descriptors for how clothing is currently being worn: "(pulled away from skin)"
- Physical states can intensify: "sweating" → "sweating heavily"
- Both characters can have outfit changes in the same message - track each separately

*The argument had gone on long enough. Marcus slammed his palm against the table.*

Marcus: "I can't do this right now." *He pushed back from the table, chair scraping loudly against the floor.* "I need some air."

*Without waiting for a response, he grabbed his jacket from the back of the chair and strode toward the front door. Elena started to follow, but he held up a hand without turning around.*

Marcus: "Don't."

*The door opened, closed firmly behind him. Through the window, Elena watched him disappear down the street, his shoulders hunched against the cold night air.*

*Lily reached over and put a hand on Elena's arm.*

Lily: "Give him time. He'll come around."

Elena: *sinking back into her chair, voice hollow* "Will he though?"

CHARACTER LEAVING SCENE (3 → 2 characters):
- Marcus LEFT THE SCENE entirely (went out the front door, watched disappearing down street)
- He is REMOVED from the output array - do not include characters who have left
- His jacket was picked up but he left with it - this is NOT a prop left behind

Elena and Lily remain:
- Elena's mood shifted from "defensive, upset, pleading" → "defeated, hurt, hollow"
- Lily's activity updated to "Comforting Elena", mood shifted to "sympathetic, concerned"
- Both outfits unchanged

Key principle: When a character LEAVES (exits building, goes outside, walks away out of sight), REMOVE them from the array entirely.

CHARACTER LEAVING TO ANOTHER ROOM (3 → 2 characters):
- Sarah left the bedroom, went down the hall, bathroom door closed and LOCKED
- She is in a different room with a closed door = NO LONGER PRESENT
- Remove her from the array - she's not in the scene anymore

Jake and Mike remain:
- Jake's activity and mood updated to reflect aftermath
- Mike's activity updated to questioning, mood shifted
- Both outfits unchanged

Key principle: When someone goes to another room AND closes the door (especially locks it), they've left the scene. The POV character cannot see or directly interact with them.

Rachel: "Yeah. Let's go to my room."

*We walked down the hallway together. I could feel Dave's eyes on our backs. Rachel opened her bedroom door and we stepped inside. She closed it firmly behind us, and I heard her flip the lock.*

POV CHARACTER MOVES WITH ANOTHER, LEAVING SOMEONE BEHIND (3 → 2 characters):
- User and Rachel BOTH moved from living room to Rachel's bedroom
- Door was closed AND locked behind them
- Dave was left in the living room - he's no longer present in the current scene
- REMOVE Dave from the array - the scene is now in the bedroom, not the living room

User and Rachel remain (they moved together):
- Both have updated positions reflecting the new room
- Both have updated moods - relief at being alone
- Outfits unchanged

Key principle: The scene follows the POV character. When POV moves to a new room with someone and shuts the door, anyone left behind is removed from the array.

CHARACTER ENTERING SCENE:

- Position moved from couch to near front door
- Activity and mood updated
- Outfit unchanged

Key principle: When a character enters (arrives, comes through door, appears), ADD them to the array. Infer what you can about their state from context.

<instructions>
<general>
- Determine the topic, tone, tension, and significant events of the scene.
- Topic should be 3-5 words summarizing the main focus.
- Tone should be 2-3 descriptive words capturing the emotional atmosphere (e.g. "Tense, suspicious" or "Warm, playful").
</general>
<tension>
- Direction will be calculated automatically, but set your best guess.
<levels>
Tension levels form a spectrum of emotional/dramatic intensity (applies to ALL tension types):
- relaxed: Low stakes, comfortable. Casual chat, downtime, nothing pressing.
- aware: Mild interest or attention. Something noted but no real stakes yet.
- guarded: Careful, measured. Testing waters - whether for trust, attraction, or safety.
- tense: Stakes feel real. Could be conflict brewing, unspoken attraction, or difficult truth approaching.
- charged: Intense emotions dominate. Anger before a fight, desire before a kiss, fear before confession.
- volatile: On the edge. One word changes everything - into violence, intimacy, or revelation.
- explosive: The moment itself. Fight breaks out, characters kiss or engage in sex, secret revealed, breakdown happens.
</levels>
<types>
Tension type describes the nature of what's driving the tension:

*The restaurant had finally emptied out, the last of the dinner crowd filtering into the rainy night outside. Elena sat across from Marcus in the corner booth, her wine glass mostly untouched, watching him struggle to find the right words. He'd asked her to dinner with that particular tone in his voice—the one that meant something important was coming—and she'd spent the entire meal waiting for the other shoe to drop.*

*The candles on the table had burned down to stubs, casting flickering shadows across his face. Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance, and the rain intensified against the windows. A waiter hovered near the kitchen door, clearly wanting to close up but too polite to interrupt.*

Elena: "Marcus, whatever it is, just say it. You've been dancing around something all night."

Marcus: *finally meeting her eyes* "I'm leaving. The job in Tokyo—I took it." *He reached across the table, his fingers brushing against hers.* "But I don't want to go without you."

*The words hung in the air between them. Elena felt her heart skip, her mind racing through a thousand implications—her career, her family, everything she'd built here. But looking at him now, vulnerable and hopeful and terrified all at once, she realized the answer wasn't as complicated as she'd thought.*

{
  "topic": "Life-changing proposal",
  "tone": "Vulnerable, electric, bittersweet",
  "tension": {"level": "charged", "type": "intimate", "direction": "escalating"}
}
</output>
<explanation>
TOPIC: "Life-changing proposal" - captures the weight of what's being asked (not just "dinner conversation" or "relationship talk"). The proposal isn't marriage, but it IS asking her to change her entire life.

TONE: Three words to capture a complex emotional atmosphere:
- "Vulnerable" - Marcus is exposing himself to rejection, Elena is confronting a huge decision
- "Electric" - the air is charged with anticipation and significance
- "Bittersweet" - whatever the answer, something will be lost (either the opportunity or her current life)

TENSION analysis:
- Level "charged": Intense emotions dominate. This is a pivotal moment—not yet at "volatile" (one word changes everything) but definitely beyond "tense" (stakes feel real)
- Type "intimate": This is about emotional/relational closeness, not conflict. Despite the stakes, they're on the same side
- Direction "escalating": Building toward a decision/revelation. The question has been asked; the answer will raise or resolve tension further

Why NOT other levels:
- Not "explosive" - the moment hasn't broken yet, she hasn't answered
- Not "volatile" - there's no sense it could go violent or completely wrong
- Not "tense" - too understated for this pivotal moment
</explanation>
</example>

<example>
<input>
*The precinct bullpen was chaos—phones ringing, detectives shouting across desks, a suspect being dragged toward booking while screaming about his rights. But Captain Rodriguez's office was an island of deadly calm. Sarah sat in the hard plastic chair across from his desk, hands folded in her lap, expression carefully neutral.*

*Rodriguez hadn't said a word since calling her in. He just sat there, reading through the file in front of him, occasionally making small noises of disapproval. The silence stretched unbearably. On the wall behind him, the clock ticked loud enough to hear—2:47 PM. She'd been sitting here for almost five minutes.*

Rodriguez: *finally looking up* "Detective Chen. Thirteen years on the force. Exemplary record." *He closed the file with a soft thump.* "So explain to me why I have Internal Affairs breathing down my neck about a missing evidence log."

Sarah: "Captain, I filed that log myself three days ago. Whatever discrepancy they found—"

Rodriguez: *holding up a hand* "I've known you a long time, Chen. Which is why I'm giving you exactly one chance to tell me what really happened before this goes any further. Because right now?" *He leaned forward, his voice dropping.* "Right now, it looks like you made something disappear. And I need to know why."

*The accusation landed like a punch. Sarah felt the blood drain from her face, her carefully maintained composure cracking at the edges.*
</input>
<output>
{
  "topic": "Internal affairs accusation",
  "tone": "Ominous, suffocating, accusatory",
  "tension": {"level": "tense", "type": "confrontation", "direction": "escalating"}
}
</output>
<explanation>
TOPIC: "Internal affairs accusation" - specific and consequential. Not just "meeting with captain" or "work trouble." The IA involvement and evidence tampering allegation are the core issue.

TONE: Captures the oppressive atmosphere:
- "Ominous" - the extended silence, the careful reading, the ticking clock all create dread
- "Suffocating" - she's trapped, the room feels small despite the chaos outside, nowhere to go
- "Accusatory" - Rodriguez isn't asking if something happened; he's telling her he knows and demanding explanation

TENSION analysis:
- Level "tense": Stakes feel real—career, reputation, possibly freedom are on the line. The confrontation is direct but still in the "explain yourself" phase
- Type "confrontation": Direct opposition between authority figure and accused. Rodriguez has power; Sarah is defending herself
- Direction "escalating": Building toward a breaking point. Rodriguez is offering "one chance" which implies escalation is coming if she doesn't satisfy him

Why "tense" and not higher:
- Not "charged": That would suggest emotional intensity dominating—this is more controlled, procedural despite the stakes
- Not "volatile": Nobody's about to snap; this is deliberate pressure, not explosive emotion
- Could become "volatile" or "charged" if she confesses or accuses back, but currently it's a calculated confrontation

*The morning sun streamed through the kitchen windows as Elena padded in wearing Marcus's oversized t-shirt, her hair a mess from sleep. Marcus was already at the stove, the smell of bacon and coffee filling the apartment. He looked over his shoulder and grinned at her sleep-rumpled appearance.*

Marcus: "There she is. I was about to send a search party."

Elena: *yawning hugely* "What time is it?"

Marcus: "Almost eleven. You were out cold." *He slid a mug of coffee across the counter toward her.* "I figured you earned it after last night."

*She wrapped her hands around the warm mug, smiling into the steam. Through the window, she could see the city skyline glittering in the sunshine, the storm from last night nothing but a memory. Her phone buzzed on the counter—probably her sister checking in—but she ignored it. The real world could wait.*

Elena: "Is that bacon I smell?"

Marcus: "And pancakes. The good ones, with the chocolate chips." *He turned back to the stove, but not before she caught the soft expression on his face.* "Sit down, I'll bring you a plate."

*She hopped onto one of the bar stools, tucking her bare feet under her, and watched him cook with a contentment she hadn't felt in years.*

{
  "topic": "Lazy morning after",
  "tone": "Warm, domestic, contented",
  "tension": {"level": "relaxed", "type": "intimate", "direction": "stable"}
}
</output>
<explanation>
TOPIC: "Lazy morning after" - captures the context (implied intimacy the night before) and current activity (casual, unhurried morning). Specific enough to be useful, not overly clinical.

TONE: All positive, soft emotions:
- "Warm" - physical (sun, coffee, cooking) and emotional (their dynamic)
- "Domestic" - the comfortable ordinariness of the scene, making breakfast together
- "Contented" - no urgency, no worry, just enjoying the moment

TENSION analysis:
- Level "relaxed": Low stakes, comfortable. Nothing pressing, nobody worried, just enjoying each other
- Type "intimate": Despite the low tension, the TYPE is intimate—they're emotionally/physically close (she's wearing his shirt, he's making her favorite breakfast)
- Direction "stable": No building or releasing of tension. The scene could continue like this indefinitely

Key insight: Low tension doesn't mean the scene isn't meaningful or intimate. "Relaxed" + "intimate" captures a loving, comfortable relationship moment. Not every scene needs conflict.

Why NOT other types:
- Not "conversation" - that implies neutral exchange, but there's clear romantic intimacy here
- Not "celebratory" - they're not celebrating anything specific, just enjoying normalcy

</output>
<why_bad>
- topic too vague: "Dinner" could be anything. Should capture what makes THIS dinner significant: "Life-changing proposal"
- tone too simple: "Romantic" is one word and doesn't capture the complexity. Use 2-3 descriptive words: "Vulnerable, electric, bittersweet"
- tension level invalid: "moderate" is not a valid level. Must use: relaxed, aware, guarded, tense, charged, volatile, explosive
- tension type invalid: "emotional" is not a valid type. Must use: conversation, negotiation, confrontation, intimate, vulnerable, suspense, celebratory
- direction invalid: "building" is not valid. Must use: escalating, stable, decreasing

- Direction will be recalculated based on level change.
- If previous direction was 'stable', strongly consider whether type or level has changed.
<levels>
Tension levels form a spectrum of emotional/dramatic intensity (applies to ALL tension types):
- relaxed: Low stakes, comfortable. Casual chat, downtime, nothing pressing.
- aware: Mild interest or attention. Something noted but no real stakes yet.
- guarded: Careful, measured. Testing waters - whether for trust, attraction, or safety.
- tense: Stakes feel real. Could be conflict brewing, unspoken attraction, or difficult truth approaching.
- charged: Intense emotions dominate. Anger before a fight, desire before a kiss, fear before confession.
- volatile: On the edge. One word changes everything - into violence, intimacy, or revelation.
- explosive: The moment itself. Fight breaks out, characters kiss or engage in sex, secret revealed, breakdown happens.
</levels>
<types>
Tension type describes the nature of what's driving the tension:
- conversation: Neutral dialogue, information exchange, casual interaction.
- negotiation: Competing interests seeking agreement. Deals, persuasion, bargaining.
- confrontation: Direct opposition or conflict. Arguments, accusations, standoffs.
- intimate: Emotional/physical closeness. Romance, deep sharing, intimacy, sexual tension.
- vulnerable: Exposure of weakness or secrets. Confessions, emotional risk, asking for help.
- suspense: Uncertainty about outcome. Waiting, anticipation, something about to happen.
- celebratory: Positive excitement. Joy, triumph, celebration, shared happiness.

*Elena set down her wine glass with deliberate care, her laughter from a moment ago fading as something shifted in her expression. Across the table, Marcus was still chuckling about the ridiculous mishap she'd just described—the time she'd accidentally called her boss "mom" in a board meeting—but Elena wasn't smiling anymore.*

Elena: "Marcus, there's something I need to tell you." *She clasped her hands together on the table, knuckles whitening.* "About that night. The night you found me at the hotel."

*The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Marcus's smile faltered, then disappeared entirely. He'd asked about that night a dozen times over the past six months, and she'd always deflected, always found a way to change the subject. The fact that she was bringing it up now...*

Marcus: "Elena, you don't have to—"

Elena: "Yes, I do." *She finally looked up at him, and he could see the fear there, the vulnerability she usually kept so carefully hidden.* "I wasn't there for a work conference. I was meeting someone. Someone I'd been talking to for months." *Her voice cracked.* "Someone I almost left you for."

*The words hung between them like broken glass.*

}
</output>
<explanation>
DRAMATIC SHIFT in scene state:

TOPIC: "Sharing embarrassing memories" → "Confession of almost-affair"
- The subject matter has completely transformed from light anecdotes to a relationship-threatening revelation
- Topic should reflect what the scene is NOW about, not what it started as

TONE: "Lighthearted, nostalgic, warm" → "Heavy, fearful, exposed"
- Complete tonal reversal - none of the original warmth remains
- "Heavy" - the weight of the confession, the "broken glass" metaphor
- "Fearful" - Elena's visible fear, her vulnerability
- "Exposed" - she's revealing her deepest secret, making herself vulnerable

TENSION changes:
- Level: "relaxed" → "volatile" (jumped multiple levels)
  * This isn't just "tense" - she's confessing to almost ending the relationship
  * "Volatile" = one word changes everything, and her next words could destroy or save them
- Type: "conversation" → "vulnerable"
  * This is about exposure of secrets, emotional risk, not casual exchange
  * She's asking for forgiveness by confessing, putting herself at his mercy
- Direction: "stable" → "escalating"
  * The revelation demands a response; tension is building toward Marcus's reaction

Why "volatile" not "explosive":
- "Explosive" is the moment itself - the fight breaking out, the breakdown happening
- We're AT the edge of explosive, but Marcus hasn't reacted yet
- His response could push it to "explosive" or start de-escalating
</explanation>
</example>

<example>
<input>
*The shouting had finally stopped. Marcus stood by the window, his back to the room, shoulders tight with tension. Elena sat on the edge of the bed where she'd collapsed after their worst fight yet, mascara-streaked tears still drying on her cheeks. Neither of them had spoken in almost five minutes.*

*Finally, Marcus turned around. His expression was unreadable, but when he spoke, his voice was quieter than she'd ever heard it.*

Marcus: "I need to know one thing." *He crossed the room slowly, stopping a few feet from the bed.* "Did you love him?"

Elena: *voice barely a whisper* "No." *She looked up at him, and for the first time tonight, she let him see everything—the regret, the shame, the desperate hope.* "I was lonely, and I was stupid, and I was looking for something I already had. But I never loved him." *She reached out tentatively.* "I love you. I've only ever loved you."

*Marcus stared at her outstretched hand for a long moment. Then, slowly, he took it.*

Marcus: "Then we figure this out." *He sat down beside her, still holding her hand.* "I don't know how yet, but... we figure it out."

{
  "topic": "Choosing forgiveness",
  "tone": "Raw, fragile, hopeful",
  "tension": {"level": "charged", "type": "vulnerable", "direction": "decreasing"}
}
</output>
<explanation>
RESOLUTION beginning - tension decreasing but still intense:

TOPIC: "Confession of almost-affair" → "Choosing forgiveness"
- The confession has been made; now the scene is about his response
- "Choosing forgiveness" captures that this is an active decision, not passive acceptance

TONE: "Heavy, fearful, exposed" → "Raw, fragile, hopeful"
- Still emotionally intense, but the quality has shifted
- "Raw" - nerves exposed, both vulnerable, the aftermath of emotional upheaval
- "Fragile" - this reconciliation could still shatter; they're being careful
- "Hopeful" - he took her hand, they're going to try

TENSION changes:
- Level: "volatile" → "charged"
  * Still intense emotions, but the immediate danger has passed
  * "Volatile" (one word changes everything) → "charged" (emotions dominate, but there's direction)
  * He's chosen to stay; that decision lowered the stakes
- Type: Still "vulnerable"
  * This remains about emotional exposure and risk
  * She's still exposed; he's now exposed too by choosing forgiveness
- Direction: "escalating" → "decreasing"
  * The worst moment has passed
  * They're moving toward resolution, not away from it
  * Tension is releasing, though slowly

Why not lower than "charged":
- This isn't "tense" (still too raw for that measured feeling)
- Definitely not "guarded" or "relaxed" - they just had their worst fight ever
- The emotions are still overwhelming; they're just now moving in a positive direction
</explanation>

<input>
*The apartment was chaos—balloons everywhere, streamers hanging from every surface, the kitchen counter covered in half-assembled party supplies. Elena stood in the middle of it all, hair in a messy bun, wearing an apron covered in frosting stains, looking utterly frazzled.*

Elena: "The cake is lopsided, Marcus. LOPSIDED." *She gestured at the three-tier monstrosity on the counter.* "Sophie's going to be here in two hours and I haven't even started the frosting and the living room still needs—"

Marcus: *catching her by the shoulders* "Hey. Breathe."

Elena: *taking a shaky breath* "I just want it to be perfect. She only turns five once, and after the year she's had with the hospital and everything—"

Marcus: "And she's going to love it." *He pulled her into a hug, despite the flour on her apron.* "She's going to love the lopsided cake and the slightly crooked streamers and the balloons that I definitely did not accidentally pop three of while inflating."

Elena: *laughing despite herself* "Three?!"

Marcus: "They were VERY aggressive balloons." *He kissed her forehead.* "Now put me to work. What needs frosting?"

*Elena finally let some of the tension drain from her shoulders. It wasn't going to be perfect. But watching Marcus gamely attempt to wield a piping bag, she realized it was going to be exactly right.*

{
  "topic": "Party preparation teamwork",
  "tone": "Reassured, warm, playful",
  "tension": {"level": "aware", "type": "conversation", "direction": "decreasing"}
}
</output>
<explanation>
STRESS → REASSURANCE transition:

TOPIC: "Birthday party crisis" → "Party preparation teamwork"
- The "crisis" has been reframed as manageable
- Focus shifted from "everything is going wrong" to "we're doing this together"
- Still party prep, but the framing is completely different

TONE: "Frantic, stressed, anxious" → "Reassured, warm, playful"
- Complete reversal through Marcus's intervention
- "Reassured" - he calmed her down, validated her stress, offered help
- "Warm" - the hug, the kiss, the physical comfort
- "Playful" - the balloon joke, her laughing despite herself

TENSION changes:
- Level: "tense" → "aware"
  * "Tense" = stakes feel real (party pressure, Sophie's health history)
  * "Aware" = mild interest/attention, something noted but manageable
  * Marcus successfully lowered the emotional temperature
- Type: "suspense" → "conversation"
  * "Suspense" was about uncertainty (will the party be okay?)
  * Now it's just two people talking, working together
  * The outcome is no longer in question - it'll be fine
- Direction: "escalating" → "decreasing"
  * She was spiraling; now she's grounded
  * The stress is actively dissipating

This shows how quickly tension can shift through emotional support - one conversation completely changed the scene's energy.

This is just copying the previous_scene without analyzing the new messages!
- The messages show a DRAMATIC confession about an almost-affair
- Topic should change: "Sharing embarrassing memories" → "Confession of almost-affair"
- Tone should change completely: "Lighthearted" → "Heavy, fearful, exposed"
- Tension should jump dramatically: "relaxed" → "volatile", "conversation" → "vulnerable"

<general>
- Identify significant events that affect the narrative, relationships, or character development.
- A "significant event" is something consequential: a revelation, promise, conflict, intimate moment, discovery, or decision.
- If nothing significant happened (just casual dialogue or routine actions), return a summary indicating no notable event.
- Focus on what actually happened, not background information or internal thoughts alone.
</general>

<summary_guidelines>
Write a DETAILED 2-sentence summary that captures:
- Specifically what happened (actions, words, reactions)
- Who was involved and their emotional state
- The context and significance of the moment

BAD (too vague): "They kissed."
GOOD: "After weeks of tension, Elena finally pulled Marcus close and kissed him softly, her hands trembling against his chest. He responded by wrapping his arms around her waist and deepening the kiss, neither of them caring that they were standing in the middle of the crowded marketplace."

BAD: "They had an argument."
GOOD: "Marcus's accusation about the missing money sent Elena into a defensive rage, her voice rising as she threw the ledger across the table at him. The confrontation ended with her storming out into the rain, leaving Marcus alone with the shattered remnants of their partnership."

- "secret_shared" is ONLY for truthful revelations

SECRET_SHARED vs SECRET_REVEALED:
- secret_shared: Character VOLUNTARILY tells someone their TRUE secret
- secret_revealed: TRUE secret is EXPOSED (found out, overheard, discovered by accident, or told by a third party)
</event_details>

<event_pairs>
MANDATORY: You MUST specify which two characters are involved in EACH event type.
Different event types can involve different character pairs!

FORMAT:
- Single pair: "combat": ["User", "Thug"]
- Multiple pairs (same event type): "combat": [["User", "Thug1"], ["User", "Thug2"]]

EXAMPLE 1 - Single pair (confession between two people):
eventTypes: ["confession", "emotional", "secret_shared"]
eventPairs: {
  "confession": ["Elena", "Marcus"],
  "emotional": ["Elena", "Marcus"],
  "secret_shared": ["Elena", "Marcus"]
}

EXAMPLE 2 - Combat with multiple enemies:
eventTypes: ["combat", "danger"]
eventPairs: {
  "combat": [["Jake", "Thug1"], ["Jake", "Thug2"]],
  "danger": ["Jake", "Thug1"]
}

EXAMPLE 3 - Mixed event (fight enemies, comfort ally):
eventTypes: ["combat", "emotional", "supportive", "intimate_embrace"]
eventPairs: {
  "combat": ["Sarah", "Guard"],
  "emotional": ["Sarah", "Alex"],
  "supportive": ["Sarah", "Alex"],
  "intimate_embrace": ["Sarah", "Alex"]
}

This is CRITICAL for tracking relationships correctly. Each event type MUST have its own pair entry.
</event_pairs>

<relationship_signals>
If events affect relationships, include relationshipSignals (array - one per affected pair).
Only include signals for MEANINGFUL relationship shifts, not routine interactions.

FORMAT: Array of signal objects, each with a pair and changes array.

EXAMPLE 1 - No relationship signal (routine combat with nameless enemies):
relationshipSignals: []

EXAMPLE 2 - Single signal (emotional moment between two characters):
relationshipSignals: [
  {
    pair: ["Elena", "Marcus"],
    changes: [
      { from: "Elena", toward: "Marcus", feeling: "vulnerable" },
      { from: "Marcus", toward: "Elena", feeling: "protective" }
    ]
  }
]

EXAMPLE 3 - Multiple signals (fight with named enemies who will remember):
relationshipSignals: [
  { pair: ["Jake", "Viper"], changes: [{ from: "Viper", toward: "Jake", feeling: "vengeful" }] },
  { pair: ["Jake", "Razor"], changes: [{ from: "Razor", toward: "Jake", feeling: "fearful" }] }
]

EXAMPLE 4 - Mixed (combat with enemy, emotional support from ally):
relationshipSignals: [
  { pair: ["Sarah", "Alex"], changes: [
    { from: "Alex", toward: "Sarah", feeling: "grateful" },
    { from: "Sarah", toward: "Alex", feeling: "protective" }
  ]}
]
(Note: No signal for Guard unless they're a recurring character)

IMPORTANT: Only create relationship signals for characters who will appear again.
Generic enemies, random NPCs, or one-off characters don't need signals.
</relationship_signals>

<witnesses>
- Include all characters who witnessed or participated in the event.
- This is important for dramatic irony (tracking who knows what).

<instructions>
<general>
- Determine the current status of the relationship (strangers, acquaintances, friendly, close, intimate, strained, hostile, complicated).
- Extract how each character feels about the other (asymmetric feelings are common and important).
- Note any secrets one character knows that the other doesn't.
- Identify what each character wants from the relationship.
</general>

<status_guidelines>
Status definitions and requirements:

- strangers: Never met or just met, no rapport
- acquaintances: Know each other casually, no strong bond
- friendly: Positive rapport, enjoy each other's company
- close: Deep friendship, trust, confide in each other. Maximum for platonic relationships.
- intimate: ONLY for romantic/sexual relationships with explicit romantic actions (kiss, date, love confession, sex)
- strained: Tension, unresolved conflict, damaged trust
- hostile: Active antagonism, enemies
- complicated: Mixed feelings, unclear relationship

CRITICAL STATUS LIMITS:
- "intimate" REQUIRES romantic actions to have occurred (first kiss, first date, love confession, sexual activity)
- Sharing secrets or emotional vulnerability alone = "close" at most, NOT "intimate"
- Caring about someone or wanting to help them = "friendly" or "close", NOT "intimate"
- "intimate" means ROMANTIC relationship, not just emotional closeness

Examples:
- Characters shared deep secrets, support each other emotionally → "close" (not intimate - no romance)
- Characters had their first kiss → can be "intimate"
- Characters confessed romantic love → can be "intimate"
- Characters care deeply about each other but no romantic actions → "close"
- Characters are suspicious but talking → "strained" or "acquaintances"
</status_guidelines>

<asymmetry>
- Each character's feelings may be very different from the other's.
- One character might be trusting while the other is suspicious.
- One might want romance while the other wants friendship.
- Capture these differences accurately.
</asymmetry>

<output_format>

IMPORTANT: Use the actual character names as keys, NOT "aToB" or "bToA".
The "toward" field clarifies who the feelings are directed at.

<secrets>
- Secrets are things one character knows about the other (or about a situation) that the other doesn't know.

<instructions>
<general>
- Analyze the previous relationship state and recent events to determine the CURRENT state.
- Update status if the relationship has progressed or deteriorated.
- REPLACE feelings with what the character CURRENTLY feels - do NOT accumulate old feelings.
  - If someone was "angry" but has forgiven, remove "angry" and add appropriate new feelings.
  - Feelings should reflect the PRESENT emotional state, not a history of all feelings ever felt.
- Add new secrets if one character learned something the other doesn't know.
- Remove secrets that have been revealed or are no longer relevant.
- Update wants based on how the relationship has evolved.
</general>

<feelings_guidance>
CRITICAL: Feelings arrays should contain CURRENT feelings only, not accumulated history.

WRONG approach (accumulating):
- Previous: ["curious", "cautious"]
- After bonding: ["curious", "cautious", "trusting", "warm"]  ← BAD: old feelings remain

CORRECT approach (replacing):
- Previous: ["curious", "cautious"]
- After bonding: ["trusting", "warm", "comfortable"]  ← GOOD: reflects current state

Think: "What does this character feel RIGHT NOW about the other person?"
