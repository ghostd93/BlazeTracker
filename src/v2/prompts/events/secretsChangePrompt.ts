### Example 1: Discovering Someone's Secret Identity
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:

Marcus: *He doesn't know she followed him. Elena watches from the shadows as Marcus approaches the homeless man - except the man rises, perfectly healthy, and hands Marcus an envelope.* "The senator's meeting is Tuesday. The guards change shift at 8:45."

Elena: *She presses herself against the cold brick, heart hammering. Marcus takes the envelope without a word, then pulls out a badge she recognizes instantly - the emblem of the Royal Intelligence Service. Her coworker. Her friend. He's a spy.*

OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Elena has discovered that Marcus is secretly a spy for the Royal Intelligence Service. She witnessed him meeting a contact and showing an RIS badge.

INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Assistant toward CEO: secrets: none

  "reasoning": "Marcus has accidentally discovered Elena's secret romantic feelings for him by reading her journal.

Jake: *His face goes still.* "How long have you known?"

Lily: "A few months. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner."

Marcus: *From downstairs.* "Babe? You find that photo album?"
"""
OUTPUT:

Queen: *Her expression remains serene, but her knuckles whiten on the armrest.* "You've done well. Speak of this to no one."

OUTPUT:

Ryan: "Actually... I already knew. I saw your applications on the computer last week. I didn't know how to bring it up."

Maya: *Surprised.* "You knew? Why didn't you say anything?"
"""
OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Maya confessed her job hunting and plans to quit - these are no longer secrets she's keeping from Ryan.

Jordan: *Reaches for his hand.* "Thank you for telling me. That took courage."
"""
OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Alex openly shared his financial situation with Jordan. This is NOT a secret Jordan now holds - it was willingly disclosed in direct conversation. Secrets are information discovered covertly or hidden from someone. Jordan simply learned something through normal communication. No secrets were added or removed for either party.",
  "changes": [

### Example 15: Previous Secret Knowledge Becomes Open Knowledge

Detective: "We've been watching you for weeks."
"""
OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "The detective revealed that she knows about the suspect's second phone. This is no longer secret knowledge - she's openly told him she knows. The suspect is now aware of what the detective knows, so it's not hidden information anymore.",
  "changes": [

Emma: "Oh Lucas... I actually already knew. I found your appointment card months ago. And I should tell you - I've been dealing with anxiety. I've been talking to my doctor about it."

Lucas: "I know. I overheard your call. I didn't want to pry, so I never mentioned it."

Emma: *Laughs tearfully.* "We're both terrible at secrets, aren't we?"

OUTPUT:

  "reasoning": "Both characters confessed what they were hiding AND revealed they already knew the other's secret. Lucas told Emma about therapy (removing his need to hide it), Emma revealed she already knew (her secret knowledge is now open).

## Bad Examples (What NOT to do)

### Bad Example 1: Confusing Public Knowledge with Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
John toward Mary: secrets: none
---
Mary: *At the party.* "Everyone, I have an announcement! John and I are engaged!"
John: *Smiling.* "I asked her last night."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "John knows they're engaged.",
  "fromCharacter": "John",
  "towardCharacter": "Mary",
  "added": ["knows about the engagement"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: This is public knowledge, not a secret. Secrets are things one character knows about another that are hidden or private. An engagement announced at a party is the opposite of secret.

### Bad Example 2: Adding Already-Established Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Elena toward Marcus: secrets: knows he has a criminal record
---
Elena: *They're having coffee.*
Marcus: "I was thinking about that trip we planned."
Elena: "Sounds good. When should we leave?"
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Elena still knows about his criminal record.",
  "fromCharacter": "Elena",
  "towardCharacter": "Marcus",
  "added": ["knows he has a criminal record"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: She already knew this. Nothing in the scene changes or adds to her secret knowledge. Adding existing secrets is redundant. The correct output would have empty added/removed arrays.

### Bad Example 3: Wrong Direction of Secret
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Sarah toward Tom: secrets: none
---
Sarah: *She writes in her diary.* "I've been skimming money from the company account. Tom has no idea."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Tom doesn't know Sarah is stealing.",
  "fromCharacter": "Tom",
  "towardCharacter": "Sarah",
  "added": ["doesn't know she's stealing"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: The direction is reversed. The question is what secrets SARAH holds about TOM, not what Tom doesn't know. "Doesn't know" is also not a secret - it's an absence of knowledge. The correct output would be no changes since Sarah didn't learn anything new about Tom.

### Bad Example 4: Treating General Information as Relationship Secret
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Detective toward suspect: secrets: none
---
Detective: *Reviews case files.* The suspect's fingerprints match those found at two other crime scenes in the district.
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Detective learned about the fingerprints.",
  "fromCharacter": "Detective",
  "towardCharacter": "suspect",
  "added": ["knows his fingerprints were at crime scenes"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: This is case evidence, not a personal secret about the suspect. Secrets in this context are hidden personal information - affairs, hidden identities, concealed motivations. Police evidence from official files doesn't fit this category.

### Bad Example 5: Not Removing Revealed Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Wife toward Husband: secrets: knows he's been gambling, found loan shark threats
---
Wife: "I found the letters from the loan sharks. I know about the gambling, Mike."
Husband: "I can explain—"
Wife: "Don't. We need to talk about how to fix this."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Wife confronts husband about gambling.",
  "fromCharacter": "Wife",
  "towardCharacter": "Husband",
  "added": [],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: When a secret is openly revealed and discussed, it's no longer a secret. The wife has confronted him - he knows she knows. The removed array should include "knows he's been gambling, found loan shark threats" because this information is now openly acknowledged.

### Bad Example 6: Vague or Useless Secret Descriptions
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Alex toward Jordan: secrets: none
---
Alex: *Overhears Jordan on the phone.* "Yes, I'm at the location. The package is secure. Extraction at midnight."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Alex heard something suspicious.",
  "fromCharacter": "Alex",
  "towardCharacter": "Jordan",
  "added": ["knows something", "heard something suspicious"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: "Knows something" and "heard something suspicious" are useless vague descriptions. Be specific: "overheard coded conversation about a package and extraction" or similar. Secrets should be specific enough to be meaningful.

### Bad Example 7: Treating Character Thoughts as Discovered Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Marcus toward Elena: secrets: none
---
Marcus: *He watches Elena work, thinking about how talented she is. She doesn't know he nominated her for the promotion.*
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Elena doesn't know Marcus nominated her.",
  "fromCharacter": "Elena",
  "towardCharacter": "Marcus",
  "added": ["doesn't know he nominated her"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: The prompt is asking about Marcus's secrets regarding Elena, not Elena's secrets. Also, "doesn't know" isn't a secret - it's a lack of knowledge. Additionally, we can't add secrets based on what the text says a character is thinking unless another character discovers those thoughts.

### Bad Example 8: Inferring Secrets Not in the Text
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Sarah toward her sister: secrets: none
---
Sister: "I'll be late to dinner tonight."
Sarah: "Okay, see you then."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Sarah might suspect her sister is hiding something.",
  "fromCharacter": "Sarah",
  "towardCharacter": "her sister",
  "added": ["suspects she's hiding something"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Nothing in the text suggests Sarah suspects anything. Being late to dinner is completely normal. The output invents a suspicion that has no basis in the provided text.

### Bad Example 9: Listing Same Secret Multiple Ways
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Tom toward his boss: secrets: none
---
Tom: *Sees his boss's email open.* The message shows plans to lay off the entire department in two weeks.
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Tom saw the layoff email.",
  "fromCharacter": "Tom",
  "towardCharacter": "his boss",
  "added": ["saw the layoff email", "knows about upcoming layoffs", "discovered termination plans", "learned department is being eliminated", "found out about job cuts"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: These are all the same piece of information phrased five different ways. Pick one clear, specific description: "discovered plans to lay off the entire department in two weeks."

### Bad Example 10: Mixing Up Who Holds the Secret
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Detective toward criminal: secrets: none
---
Criminal: *In interrogation, he accidentally mentions a warehouse address the police don't know about.*
Detective: *Makes a mental note of the address.*
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "The criminal revealed the warehouse.",
  "fromCharacter": "criminal",
  "towardCharacter": "Detective",
  "added": ["accidentally revealed the warehouse location"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: The direction is backwards. The detective now holds secret knowledge about the criminal (knows a warehouse address connected to him), not the criminal holding a secret about the detective. fromCharacter should be Detective, towardCharacter should be criminal.

### Bad Example 11: Not Recognizing Partial Reveals
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Maria toward Carlos: secrets: knows he's an undercover cop, knows his real identity
---
Maria: "I know you're a cop, Carlos. Or should I say... Officer?"
Carlos: *Freezes.* "How long have you known?"
Maria: "Long enough."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Maria revealed she knows he's a cop.",
  "fromCharacter": "Maria",
  "towardCharacter": "Carlos",
  "added": [],
  "removed": ["knows he's an undercover cop", "knows his real identity"]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: She only revealed that she knows he's a cop - she didn't reveal that she knows his real identity. The "real identity" secret could still be held. Only remove the specific secret that was revealed.

### Bad Example 12: Treating Character Observations as Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Emma toward Jack: secrets: none
---
Emma: *She notices Jack looks tired today, dark circles under his eyes.*
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Emma noticed Jack looks tired.",
  "fromCharacter": "Emma",
  "towardCharacter": "Jack",
  "added": ["noticed he looks tired", "saw dark circles under his eyes"],
  "removed": []
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Observable facts like someone looking tired aren't secrets. Secrets are hidden information - things a character wouldn't want others to know or that aren't publicly apparent. Dark circles are visible to anyone.

### Bad Example 13: Treating Openly Shared Information as a Secret
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Tom toward Sarah: secrets: none
Sarah toward Tom: secrets: none
---
Sarah: "I should be honest with you, Tom. I was married before. It ended badly - he was abusive. I left him three years ago."

Tom: *Takes her hand gently.* "Thank you for trusting me with that."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Tom now knows about Sarah's past marriage.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Tom",
      "towardCharacter": "Sarah",
      "added": ["knows she was previously married", "knows her ex was abusive"],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Sarah TOLD Tom this information directly and voluntarily. This is not secret knowledge Tom holds about Sarah - it's information she openly shared with him. Secrets are things discovered covertly or that someone doesn't know you know. Tom knowing about her past is just normal knowledge gained through conversation, not a secret.

### Bad Example 14: Not Removing Listener's Secret When It Was Openly Discussed
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Mark toward Jenny: secrets: none
Jenny toward Mark: secrets: discovered he's planning a surprise party for her, saw the guest list
---
Mark: "Okay, I can't keep this in anymore. I'm planning a surprise birthday party for you! I've invited everyone!"

Jenny: *Laughs.* "I know! I accidentally saw the guest list last week. I've been pretending to be surprised."

Mark: "You knew?! This whole time?"
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Mark revealed the party plans.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Mark",
      "towardCharacter": "Jenny",
      "added": [],
      "removed": []
    },
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Jenny",
      "towardCharacter": "Mark",
      "added": [],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Jenny's secret knowledge should be REMOVED. She revealed that she already knew about the party - Mark now knows that she knew. Her secret "discovered he's planning a surprise party" is no longer secret because she told him she knew. The correct output would remove both secrets from Jenny toward Mark.

### Bad Example 15: Adding Secrets For Information Told Directly
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Lisa toward Mike: secrets: none
Mike toward Lisa: secrets: none
---
Lisa: "Mike, I need to tell you something. I'm pregnant. It's yours."

Mike: *Stunned silence, then tears.* "We're... we're going to be parents?"
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Mike learned Lisa is pregnant.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Mike",
      "towardCharacter": "Lisa",
      "added": ["knows she's pregnant", "knows he's the father"],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Lisa TOLD Mike directly. This is not secret knowledge Mike holds - it's information she chose to share with him openly. You cannot add secrets for things someone was directly told. The correct output would have no changes for either direction.

### Bad Example 16: Not Removing Secret After Confrontation
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Rachel toward David: secrets: knows he's been lying about working late, tracked his phone to a bar
David toward Rachel: secrets: none
---
Rachel: "I know you haven't been working late, David. I tracked your phone. You've been at O'Malley's Bar every Thursday."

David: *His face drains of color.* "Rachel, I can explain—"

      "fromCharacter": "Rachel",
      "towardCharacter": "David",
      "added": [],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: Rachel REVEALED her secret knowledge to David. He now knows that she knows. This is no longer secret information - it's been openly confronted. The secrets "knows he's been lying about working late" and "tracked his phone to a bar" should be REMOVED because David is now fully aware she has this knowledge.

### Bad Example 17: Keeping Secrets After Mutual Disclosure
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Anna toward Ben: secrets: found his journal, knows he's in love with her
Ben toward Anna: secrets: overheard her tell friend she has feelings for him
---
Anna: "Ben, I read your journal. I know how you feel about me."

Ben: "And I overheard you talking to Claire last week. I know you feel the same way."

Anna: *Blushes.* "So we've both been keeping secrets..."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "They both revealed what they knew.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Anna",
      "towardCharacter": "Ben",
      "added": [],
      "removed": ["found his journal"]
    },
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Ben",
      "towardCharacter": "Anna",
      "added": [],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: BOTH secrets should be fully removed from BOTH directions. Anna told Ben she read his journal and knows his feelings - remove ALL her secrets. Ben told Anna he overheard her - remove ALL his secrets. The output only partially removed secrets and missed Ben's entirely. When something is openly discussed, it's no longer a secret for either party.

### Bad Example 18: Treating Basic Facts as Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Marcus toward Opal: secrets: none
---
Opal: *The unicorn trots into the tavern, her pearlescent horn catching the firelight.* "Hello there! I'm Opal. I grew up by the Sapphire Coast - nothing like these inland towns."

Marcus: "Welcome to the Silver Stallion. What brings you so far from the sea?"
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Marcus learned several things about Opal.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Marcus",
      "towardCharacter": "Opal",
      "added": ["knows she is a unicorn", "knows she is called Opal", "knows she is from the seaside"],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: None of these are secrets!
- "knows she is a unicorn" - He can literally SEE she's a unicorn. Observable facts are not secrets.
- "knows she is called Opal" - She INTRODUCED HERSELF. She knows he knows her name. Not a secret.
- "knows she is from the seaside" - She TOLD HIM this directly. Information shared in conversation is not a secret.
The correct output has NO secrets added. These are all just normal information learned through observation and conversation.

### Bad Example 19: Treating Self-Introductions as Secrets
INPUT:
"""
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP:
Elena toward new coworker: secrets: none
---
New coworker: "Hi, I'm James. I just transferred from the Chicago office. I'm the new project manager for the Henderson account. I've been with the company for about five years."

Elena: "Nice to meet you! I'm Elena, I handle client relations."
"""
WRONG OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning": "Elena learned about James's background.",
  "changes": [
    {
      "fromCharacter": "Elena",
      "towardCharacter": "new coworker",
      "added": ["knows his name is James", "knows he transferred from Chicago", "knows he's the project manager", "knows he's been with the company five years"],
      "removed": []
    }
  ]
}
WHY THIS IS WRONG: James TOLD her all of this! He introduced himself and shared his background willingly. Would James be shocked that Elena knows his name after he said "I'm James"? Of course not. None of this is secret - it's a normal workplace introduction. The correct output has NO changes.

export const secretsChangePrompt: PromptTemplate<ExtractedSecretsChange> = {
	name: 'secrets_change',
	description: 'Extract changes in secrets one character holds regarding another character',

	],

	systemPrompt: `You are analyzing roleplay messages to detect changes in secrets one character holds about another.

## Your Task
Given the current relationship state and new messages, identify any secrets that have been added (newly discovered) or removed (revealed/no longer secret) for the specified directional relationship.

## Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "reasoning": Your analysis of what secret information was discovered or revealed for BOTH directions
- "changes": Array of changes for each direction (A toward B, and B toward A). Each change object has:
  - "fromCharacter": The character who holds (or held) the secret
  - "towardCharacter": The character the secret is about
  - "added": Array of newly discovered secrets (empty if none)
  - "removed": Array of secrets that are no longer hidden (empty if none)

IMPORTANT: You must analyze BOTH directions of the relationship and include both in the changes array. If no changes occurred in a direction, include it with empty added/removed arrays.

## CRITICAL: What IS and IS NOT a Secret

### A SECRET requires ALL of these conditions:
1. The information was obtained COVERTLY (the other person doesn't know you have it)
2. The other person would be surprised/affected to learn you know this
3. You are actively concealing that you have this knowledge

### Ways to OBTAIN a secret (covert discovery):
- Overheard a private conversation (they didn't know you were listening)
- Found documents/evidence (they didn't know you saw them)
- Witnessed something secretly (they didn't know you were watching)
- A third party told you something they're hiding (they don't know you were told)
- Discovered through investigation (they don't know you found out)

### What is NOT a secret (just ordinary knowledge):
- ANYTHING someone tells you directly in conversation - this is just information, not a secret
- Information shared openly between characters - both parties know
- Observable facts anyone can see - not hidden
- Public information or records - not concealed
- Things you learned because someone chose to share them with you

### NEVER add these as secrets - they are NEVER secrets:
- Someone's NAME (they introduced themselves - they know you know their name!)
- Someone's SPECIES/RACE (you can see what they are - a unicorn, an elf, a human)
- Someone's APPEARANCE (hair color, eye color, height - these are visible)
- Where they're FROM if they mentioned it (they told you, so they know you know)
- Their JOB/OCCUPATION if they mentioned it (they told you)
- Their AGE if they mentioned it (they told you)
- ANYTHING about them that is visually obvious or that they introduced themselves with
- Basic biographical facts shared in normal conversation

Ask yourself: "Would this person be SHOCKED to learn I know this?"
- If someone told you their name, they would NOT be shocked you know it.
- If you can see someone is a unicorn, they would NOT be shocked you noticed.
- If someone mentioned they're from the seaside, they would NOT be shocked you remember.

### The key test: "Does the other person know that I know this?"
- If YES → Not a secret (it's openly shared knowledge)
- If NO → Could be a secret (if discovered covertly)

## When Secrets Are Removed
Remove secrets when:
- You TELL them what you know (they now know you know)
- They TELL you directly (it's no longer hidden - just shared knowledge)
- You confront them about it (you've revealed your knowledge)
- It becomes openly discussed between you

## CRITICAL: Told In Scene = NOT A SECRET

**If A tells B something in the scene:**
- This is NOT a secret B holds about A
- B simply learned information through normal conversation
- Only add secrets for COVERT discovery, never for direct disclosure

**If A reveals they know something about B:**
- REMOVE A's secret (B now knows A knows)
- The information is no longer hidden

**If B already had secret knowledge and A tells B the same thing:**
- REMOVE B's secret (it's now openly shared, not covertly held)

NEVER add a secret for information that was directly communicated in conversation. Secrets require the other person to be UNAWARE you have the information.

## Key Guidelines
- Secrets are DIRECTIONAL: Character A's secrets about B are different from B's secrets about A
- Be specific in descriptions - "knows about his affair" not "knows something"
- Observable facts (looks tired, seems sad) are NOT secrets
- Case evidence or public records are NOT personal secrets
- Don't add secrets that already exist in the relationship state
- Empty arrays are valid if no changes occurred
